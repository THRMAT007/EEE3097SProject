Demonstration requires a suitable water container, we elected to use a 25L water drum for easy of showing the water level changing, and due to the fact that neither Ross or Matthew owns a rain water tank suitible for the demonstation.  
For the Demonstation the user is required to have a waterproof LM335z temperature sensor. we achieved this by sealing the sensor in silicon and then using heat shrink to encuse it.  
the VL53L1X-satel sensor needs to be mounted level and to have a clear line of site to the water level.  
the water container should ideally not have any light inside the tank, so this affects the accuracy of the VL53L1X sensor, so any openings in the water container should be convered and closed off.  

So in the demonstation we ensure that there was a clear line of side to the water level, a spirit level was used but the wires connected to the sensor made it difficult to keep the sensor contantly level, ideally the vl53l1x sensor should be attached to a surface whne measuring.  
the lm335 sensors where waterproof and one of the sensors was inserted into the tank on the opposite side to the vl53l1x sensor, the opening where the sensor was inserted was then taped closed to avoid loght polutuons. 
the demonstation then shows the the temperature sensors are working, and that they have not been damaged by the water due to poor waterproofing. the to desmonstate that the VL53L1X sensor is recoding tha water level, a plug is pulled on the water tank to allow the water to flow out. this demonstraights the water level changing.  
then there is a demonstation of the API menu and the relavent setting that the user can change, and the db where the data is logged.
